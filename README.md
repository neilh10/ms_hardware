Hardware Designs, BOMS (Bill of Materials) for Modular Sensors projects

These are desinged to work with Modular Sensors Mayfly hardware or be "wing boards" designed to be plugged into the Mayfly board.
Some may work with other hardware interfaces.

ec_analog - B031 - Electrical Conductivity interface as a Mayfly Wingboard.

The EC_interface, designed as a "Stream Disconnect" or "Stream Intermitency" using electrical conductivity, is described https://github.com/neilh10/ModularSensors/wiki/Stream-Disconnect-EC-Monitor
