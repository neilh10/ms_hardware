# enclosures ~ outdoor environment

This document is the authors notes for a few enclosures that are outdoor and capable of being attached to a small pole or flat surface.

The enclosures are selected to provide IP65 protections for Mayfly (rev0.5) 
Ingress Protection code has a definition at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code
IP65 is 
6 Dust-tight	No ingress of dust; complete protection against contact (dust-tight).   
5  Water jets	Water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm (0.25 in)) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects.   


A final product/device    
is usually a result of seperate parts, including a built Mayfly, solar panel+battery, Cables and sensors        
assembled together as workorder    
and finally tested to a finished specification.   

This identifies some of the enclosures, and ways a Mayfly can be secured in the enclosure,  
any body using these needs to identify if it fits their project, 
and does the final built item meet the requirements of their project.     
The final worked product maynot have complete IP65, depending on other components that are selected.
