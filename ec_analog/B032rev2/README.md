# hw_mayfly ec_interfae B032rev2
Electrical Conductivity interface boards for a) EnviroDIY Mayfly board, and as hardware option b) standalone over Seeed 4pin 2pin connection

Board https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/WSMDBFEB    
The board, developed by me, has an internal designator of B032rev2. It was developed with EasyPc v20.0, design files are not published as propietary non-standard tool, and too dificult to seperate out all parts to make a meaningfull open source distribution    

The parts are specified in B032_r2 (Bill of MaterialsAzAA)200619_1056.xlsx - one page is a Digikey sheet.    
To send to Digikey, in sheet  [overview ]set the BldQty.     
Save the whole of the file.    
Step to sheet [Digikey1] file, inspect parts,  then  save that pages to a file something like B032r2_digikey_dateRef.csv - specifiy CSV as this will just save this page. Don't save the whole file to XLS.   
Then upload file B032r2_digikey_dateRef.csv  to Digikey.com    

Use    

B032_r2 silkTop_200619.pdf  for parts placement
